# Installation

## Requirements
You must have a code editor or tool which you will use to develop your website and use to debug. See [How Do I - Install IDE tool](../docs/howdoi.md/#Install IDE tool)

You need to have PHP7.1 or greater installed on the command line. See [How Do I - Install PHP](../docs/howdoi.md/#Install PHP)

After PHP is installed, Composer can be easily installed See [How Do I - Install Composer](../docs/howdoi.md/#Install Composer)

You will also require OpenSSL which will assist in auto-generating authentication tokens. See [How Do I - Install OpenSSL](../docs/howdoi.md/#Install OpenSSL)

## Composer Installation
Once the prerequisites have been installed you can create a project folder and proceed to run the Tina4 installation.

Running this in your command line will install Tina4 and create all the dependencies between your libraries and components.

Navigate to your project folder

```bash
1. Ensure your command terminal is in the right directory by running this command:
    
    cd your_project_folder

2. Run "composer require andrevanzuydam/tina4php" in your command terminal
```

aaaaaaaaaand Voila! Tina4 is installed.
